In this paper, we proposed an adaptive learning method for medical image segmentation.
The proposed method quantifies the model's epistemic uncertainty using MC Dropout and utilizes this as a metric for segmentation difficulty.
By dynamically controlling the shape parameter of the PolyDice-1 Loss based on the obtained difficulty metric,
we realized an adaptive learning strategy that assigns steeper gradients to difficult images and gentler gradients to easy images.
In evaluation experiments using the CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG datasets,the proposed method achieved performance surpassing
not only existing methods such as Dice Loss and Focal Loss but also the ideal fixed parameter setting.In particular,
for cases that were difficult to segment with conventional methods,the Dice coefficient improved by $0.36$ on the CVC-ClinicDB dataset,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive learning strategy for detecting challenging lesions.
Future work includes the automatic optimization of hyperparameters and the extension of the method to 3D medical images such as CT and MRI.
